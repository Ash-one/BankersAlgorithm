# Banker'sAlgorithm
gui.py is the latest version which have a better method to exit the while-loop  
Banker'sAlgorithm.py is no longer to be updated, because there are some reference-value errors which were solved in gui.py and I don't like to fix the same bugs XD

TO RUN gui.py, you need module:
> wxpython  

I recommend only gui.py
